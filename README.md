# EBB42-Stealthburner-CW1-Mount
ebb42 mount for cw1 nema17 pancake with umbilical strain relief

Decided to go to canbus umbilical for my stealthburner on cw1 and remove both x and y cable chains.
As the ebb42 is a new product there had been no mounts that have been released at that time so i came up with this design.
The mount sits comfortably on the rear of my extruder nema17 pancake motor and spaces the ebb42 nicely away from the rear of the motor, the m3 motor screws i have are slightly to long so i used spacers on top of the ebb42 to counteract this, also i used a cable strain relief to protect the 4 wires to the ebb42 which the dimentions are 5mm hole, 28mm length, diameter 11.8mm, slot diameter 7.55mm x2.1mm which goes into a little slide in wedge to hold into place and also used expandable braided sleeving size 3-9mm which protects the wires and sits nice and snug in the strain relief.

i also modified the original stealthburner cw1 pcb cover by Demosth (https://www.teamfdm.com/files/file/535-stealthburner-cw1-pcb-cover) to fit with this mount.
